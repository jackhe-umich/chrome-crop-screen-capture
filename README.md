# Screencap Search

This is a simple extension for Google Chrome designed to allow the user to take a screenshot and then perform a reverse image search through various search engines.

This is a school project for EECS 441 at the University of Michigan, and the codebase here was originally adapted from [an extension by Parminder Klair](https://github.com/perminder-klair/chrome-crop-screen-capture). Feel free to fork and modify.

2. Open up Chrome and go to the extensions page (Window → Extensions)
